🏠 DSM NEIGHBORHOOD SCORING ASSESSMENT:
======================================================================
### PROPERTY DESCRIPTION:
The image shows a two-story residential house with a brick lower level and light gray siding on the upper level. The house has a gray shingle roof and a detached garage to the right. The front yard is overgrown with grass and weeds. There are two trash bins near the driveway. The house appears to be in a suburban neighborhood with mature trees surrounding it.

### DETAILED ASSESSMENT BY CRITERIA:
1. **General exterior condition**: The exterior appears to be in fair condition, but shows signs of neglect. The siding looks a bit dull and could benefit from a wash. The brick on the lower level seems relatively intact, but there are some areas with discoloration. The overall impression is that the house hasn't had a significant exterior refresh in some time.
2. **Porch/entryway**: The porch is small and appears to be in decent condition, although a bit cluttered with overgrown vegetation. The steps and railing seem structurally sound, but could benefit from a fresh coat of paint. The entryway itself looks somewhat uninviting due to the lack of attention to detail.
3. **Landscaping**: The landscaping is a significant area of concern. The lawn is overgrown with weeds, and the bushes and flowerbeds appear neglected. There is no clear indication of recent gardening or maintenance. This contributes to an overall impression of the property being unkempt.
4. **Roof, gutters and downspouts**: The roof appears to be in good condition from this angle, with no obvious signs of warping or damage. The gutters and downspouts are present, but appear to be somewhat dirty, suggesting they haven't been cleaned recently.
5. **Windows**: The windows appear to be in good condition, with no visible cracks or damage. The curtains are present, but don't add much to the curb appeal. The screens are not clearly visible to assess their condition.
6. **Extra personal touches**: There are minimal extra personal touches visible. There are no porch lights, house numbers are present but not prominent, and there are no seasonal decorations. This lack of detail contributes to a less welcoming appearance.

### RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED:
- Overgrown and unmaintained landscaping.
- Dirty gutters.
- Dull exterior siding.
- Lack of personal touches and curb appeal.

### OVERALL DSM SCORE: 3 - IN-BETWEEN
**Score: 3 - In-Between**

### JUSTIFICATION:
The house exhibits several characteristics of a "3 - In-Between" score. While the structural elements like the roof and windows seem to be in decent condition, there's a noticeable lack of attention to detail in the landscaping, exterior cleanliness, and overall curb appeal. The overgrown yard and dirty gutters are clear indicators of neglect, but there aren't enough red flags to warrant a lower score. It appears the property is not actively being invested in, but also doesn't show overwhelming signs of distress.

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **Landscaping:** Implement a landscaping plan to address the overgrown lawn and neglected flowerbeds. This could involve mowing, weeding, planting, and mulching.
- **Exterior Wash:** Consider washing the siding to remove dirt and grime, which would improve its appearance.
- **Gutter Cleaning:** Clean the gutters and downspouts to ensure proper drainage.
- **Porch Refresh:** Paint the porch steps and railing to enhance their appearance.
- **Add Personal Touches:** Install porch lights and consider adding house numbers or seasonal decorations to improve curb appeal.
